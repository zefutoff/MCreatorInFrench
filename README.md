# MCreatorFrench

## About the plugin
This plugin translates the texts in French for all French speakers.

As MCreator doesn't support translations for everything, this plugin only translates the following elements:

* Dialogues
* Actions
* Mod elements (name and description)
* Workspace categories
* Global Triggers
* Procedure categories
* Procedure Blocks (Not complete yet)
* In-app helps

We will also translate the in-app tips in future versions.


## Translators:
* Goldorion
* Loic_MaitreDuFeu
* Superbroche
* Max094_Reikeb


## Install Instructions:
### For Windows:
This plugin can't be installed as other plugins. To install it, you need to go inside the folder you installed MCreator. Then, open the folder named "plugins". Finally, remove of this folder the plugin named "mcreator-localization" (it's the default plugin with English translations) and then, add this plugin. Finally, restart MCreator, and you should see French translations.
### For Mac:
To install it, find where you installed the bundled MCreator application. Right click it and chose "show package contents." Then, nagivate to Contents -> MacOS -> plugins. Then, remove of this folder the plugin named "mcreator-localization" (it's the default plugin with English translations) and then, add this plugin's zip file. Finally, restart MCreator, and you should see French translations.

**Warning!!!**

You will still see English texts, and it's normal. It's not a bug. Currently, we can't translate or we didn't have finish to translate everything. So, keep an eye on this pageor on the GitHub because we will update this plugin often, until we will have translated everything we can.
